# DALLE-pytorch v10

This is a forked repo from https://github.com/lucidrains/DALLE-pytorch. Main changes are in train_dalle.py, generate.py and genrank.py.

Full env info available in environment.yml and requirements.txt.

cub200_bpe_vsize_7800.json BPE is not mine and is taken from https://github.com/kobiso/DALLE-reproduction. CLIP rerank visualization also borrows from there.
